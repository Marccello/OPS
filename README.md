Hello! My name is Marcelo Amaral, the creator of the Onshore Power Supply Evaluator.

This program aims to help the preliminary studies of implementing onshore power supply to moored vessels at any port in the world.
Before running this executable, make sure that you have a database file in .csv format containing the data for the vessels that were in port during the period of interest. The minimum requirements for the database file are vessel type, gross tonnage, actual arrival time and actual time of departure.

Thank you for downloading the Onshore Power Supply Evaluator!
